    <h2>Frequently asked Questions</h2>

    <p>
        These questions might have been asked frequently if I hadn't answered them here ;-)
    </p>

    <details>
        <summary>Why does this site exist?</summary>

        <p>Because I wanted it.</p>

        <p>
            There is a small renaissance of having your own, personal website, independent of the
            large corporate entities. A place for your thoughts and ideas that you own and control. It's sometimes
            called the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> or
            <a href="https://communitywiki.org/wiki/SmolNet">SmolNet</a> - back in my day it was just having a
            homepage.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love reading texts written by real people. Texts that don't want to sell something.
            But how can you discover texts you can't search for because you don't know they exist?
        </p>

        <p>
            That's where this page comes in. Click a button, be surprised and maybe discover your new favorite thing.

    <details>
        <summary>What are the sources?</summary>

        <p>I initially seeded the database with personal websites from the following sources:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://personalsit.es">personalsit.es</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30934529">Ask HN: Share your personal site</a> and the
                helpful <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30963947">list of URLs extracted</a> from that
                post
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/directory">The IndieWeb Webring</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            To further grow it, you can suggest your own or a friend's personal site (as long as it has an RSS feed):
            <a href="suggest">Suggest a page</a>.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>How many blogs and posts are in the database?</summary>

        <p>Here are the current statistics:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>{{ stats.feeds }}</b> Websites with a feed</li>
            <li><b>{{ stats.items }}</b> posts overall</li>
            <li><b>{{ stats.recentitems }}</b> posts in the last six months</li>
            <li><b>{{ (stats.size / 1024 / 1024) |round(2) }} MiB</b> database size</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Currently only recent posts (published within the last six months) are used when
            picking a random post.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Can I have the data?</summary>

        <p>Sure, you can download the list of blog URLs as JSON here:</p>

        <p><a href="export">Download JSON</a></p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Broken Links, Spam, etc.</summary>

        <p>People abandon or sell their domains. Things break. Sites get hacked.</p>

        <p>
            If you got sent to a broken site, please let me know at
            <a href="mailto:andi@splitbrain.org">andi@splitbrain.org</a>. Be sure to include the ID shown under each
            visited link on the front page - it helps me to identify the broken URLs.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Are there any alternatives?</summary>

        <p>There are other attempts at making the indieweb discoverable.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://blogsurf.io/">Blog Surf</a>: a blog search engine. It lists a few random posts
                on the start page, but they are sorted by some kind of popularity score.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://search.marginalia.nu/explore/random">Marginalia</a>: another indieweb search engine.
                This one has an option to visually browse random sites.
            </li>

        </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>What tech does this run on?</summary>

        <p>This is a very simple, custom PHP application standing on the shoulders of giants:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://simplepie.org/">SimplePie</a> for RSS discovery and parsing</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> for data storage</li>
            <li><a href="https://twig.symfony.com/">Twig</a> for templating</li>
            <li><a href="https://simplecss.org/">SimpleCSS</a> for nice looks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The rest is just glue code. You can see it all on
            <a href="https://github.com/splitbrain/blogrng">Github</a>.

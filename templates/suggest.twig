        <summary>What sites can be submitted?</summary>

        <p>
            I haven't decided on any firm rules. If it's a personal site with an RSS feed, it is probably
            welcome.
        </p>

        <p>No illegal stuff, no corporate blogs, no nazis.</p>

        <p>
            Make sure your site has a valid RSS or ATOM feed. JSON Feed is not supported.
            If you're not sure, you can check with a service like
            the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/">W3C Feed Validation Service</a>. Pay especially close
            attention that your feed is served with the correct MIME type.
        </p>

        <p>
            When submitting your site, the feed parser will try to autodetect the feed URL. If it fails, you can
            always submit the feed URL manually.

        <summary>Using the Android Share Menu</summary>

        <p>
            When you install indieblog.page as a Progressive Web App (PWA), you can find it in the share menu and
            easily suggest new blogs that way. If you missed the prompt earlier, you can still find the option to
            install in your browser's menu.
